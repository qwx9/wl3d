.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Wl3d
is a port of id Software's Wolfenstein 3-D engine.
In short, Wolfenstein 3-D is...
.PP
.RS
"a masterpiece of wild action and unbelievable graphics, bringing you virtual reality at its best, as you move
.RI though (sic)
a sensationally realistic 3-D world of amazing detail.
It's World War II, and you are B.J. Blazkowicz - the Allies' bad boy of espionage, a terminal action seeker built for abuse with an attitude to match.
There's just one small problem: you've been captured by the Nazis, tortured, and imprisoned beneath the Castle Wolfenstein where you await execution.
Bummer.
Now, you must do anything to escape from the belly of a Nazi dungeon - or die trying."
.RE
.PP
.I Wl3d
requires several data files to operate, containing sound effects, music, and several types of graphics.
These are detailed in
.IR wl3d (6) .
Two additional files contain the initial loading screens,
.L intro.wl6
and
.LR intro.sod .
The first is used in Wolfenstein 3-D related game versions, the second in Spear of Destiny related game versions.
.PP
At startup, the current working directory is bound over
.I datadir
(default
.BR /sys/games/lib/wl3d )
with the
.B MBEFORE
and
.B MCREATE
flags.
Data files can thus be contained in a system directory while the config and save files' location, which are user-specific, can be left at the user's discretion.
If these user-specific files exist and
.I wl3d
fails to parse them, they are not overwritten.
.PP
Several options modify the program's behavior on startup.
If the
.B -w
parameter is used, the game starts immediately at map number
.IR map ,
and
.B -x
optionally sets the game difficulty.
.PD
.SS Game versions
The engine supports several game versions, each requiring different data files.
These also control parts of the program's behavior, such as level ordering and interface drawing.
Each corresponds to a specific data file extension.
.PD
The default game version is Wolfenstein 3-D 1.4 retail, and the data files use the
.L wl6
extension.
Others are set by the following options:
.TF -2
.TP
.B -d
Wolfenstein 3-D 1.4 shareware
.TP
.B -s
Spear of Destiny
.TP
.B -o
Spear of Destiny demo
.TP
.B -2
Spear of Destiny Mission 2: Return to Danger
.TP
.B -3
Spear of Destiny Mission 3: The Ultimate Challenge
.PD
.PP
The respective data file extensions are
.LR wl1 ,
.LR sod ,
.LR sdm ,
.LR sd2 ,
.LR sd3 .
.PD
Other game versions are unsupported.
.PD
.SS Sound and music
.I Wl3d
uses
.SM OPL2
chip emulation based on fmopl.c from the
.SM MAME
project for music and sound effects.
Digital sound effects are resampled prior to playback.
PC speaker sound effects are unimplemented and ignored.
In case
.L /dev/audio
(see
.IR audio (3))
is inaccessible, audio is ignored.
.PD
.SS Differences
Most of
.I wl3d
has been rewritten from scratch, and some parts have been implemented differently from the reference.
Most importantly, individual data lumps are no longer read and cached as needed, but rather all loaded into memory, uncompressed, and in some cases converted, at startup.
This bumps the required amount of free memory up to around 4 megabytes, depending on the game version and architecture.
In addition, a single executable handles all supported game versions.
.PP
Intro screens are now additional data files to be loaded on start up, rather than being compiled in, and must therefore be installed in the
.IR datadir .
Also unlike the reference implementation, these are displayed during data file loading, and are immediately faded out of afterwards.
.PP
Copy protection code and the Spear of Destiny Jukebox have been excised.
.PP
Menus are implemented differently, and some have been altered in functionality.
.PP
Game keys are no longer set in the options menu, but rather in the config file.
A single global configuration file is used, rather than a version dependent one.
In addition, while savegames are in a compatible format, config files are not.

.SH BUGS
Timing code may be off, but it's difficult to tell because of other implementation differences with the original engine.
.PP
Because of limitations in fmopl.c-based
.SM OPL2
emulation, Adlib sound effects crack too much during playback.
.PP
With sound effects enabled, the
.SM OPL2
emulation runs on every frame and
.L /dev/audio
is written to, even when no sound is playing.
.PP
The upsampling implementation for digital sound effects is overkill given the number of constraints.
.PP
No special handling is done if the program is unable to run at a framerate of 70 Hz.
.SH HISTORY
id Software's Wolfenstein 3-D was released for
.SM MS-DOS
on May 5, 1992.
.br
.I Wl3d
appeared first for 9front (May, 2016), based on the source code release of Wolfenstein 3-D's engine from July 21, 1995.
